Project Vision

UGotIt? aims to help instructors evaluate the learning status of the students in their online/in-person classes in real time. 
The application will detect students' facial expression during online courses via screen recording on the instructor's side or have camera facing students in in-person classes to see if students are engaged, thinking, confused, uninterested.
The application will notify the instructor if over 50% of students are uninterested or confused.
