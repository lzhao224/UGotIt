### Project Vision

UGotIt? aims to help instructors evaluate the learning status of the students in their online/in-person classes in real time. 
The application will detect students' facial expression during online courses via screen recording on the instructor's side or have camera facing students in in-person classes to see if students are engaged, thinking, confused, not interested.

### Current project functions
Detects faces through webcam and identifies the emotion as engaged, thinking, confused, and not interested. Also provide a summarized count for each category for better evaluation of results.
