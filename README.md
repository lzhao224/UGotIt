My friend who used to teach at an online summer camp told me a story. She said that she could tell if a student was thinking or had mastered the material by looking at the student's face. So she constantly reorganizes the lecture if most students have a confused faces. The problem is that she doesn't have the energy to pay attention to all the students, especially when she talks about the materials in PowerPoint presentation mode!

We create the UGotIt application as an easy, one-click solution for the teaching faculties. This program is easy to use, and it provides real-time status monitoring. We believe this project will help teachers interact with students more closely. In addition, this application can be applied in a wide range of institutions, from elementary schools to universities. 

### Project Vision

UGotIt? aims to help instructors evaluate student's learning status in their online/in-person classes in real-time. 
The application will detect students' facial expressions during online courses via screen recording on the instructor's side or have a camera facing students in in-person classes to see if students are engaged, thinking, confused, or not interested.

### Current project functions
Detects faces through webcam or browser window and identifies the emotion as engaged, thinking, confused, and not interested. Also, provide a summarized count for each category to evaluate results better. The real-time capture demo will be removed and only the stats popup will show if any teacher installs this application to protect the students' privacy. The video stream is displayed in this project only to show how the application works.

### Challenges
The major challenge is data collection. We need a large set of labeled data for a better training result. This isn't easy to collect within the time frame of this Hackathon. We made a program to convert any video source to a set of labeled images as training and testing data. We recorded the faces of our team members as the training and testing data. In the future, more data needs to be collected for this application.
